Brave never remembers what you do in a Private Window. Sites you visit won't show up in your history. Cookies, form data, and site data vanish when you close the window. Note that your activity could still be visible to your internet service provider, passive network observers, or your employer (if you're using a work machine or network). For more privacy, open a private window with Tor.
